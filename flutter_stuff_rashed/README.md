# Flutter Application: flutter_stuff_rashed

This guide will help you navigate to the `flutter_stuff_rashed` folder and run the Flutter application. Follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Flutter**: Make sure Flutter is installed on your system. You can download it from [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. **Add Flutter to PATH**: Ensure the `flutter` command is available in your terminal by adding Flutter's `bin` directory to your system PATH.
3. **Install a Code Editor**: Install an editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Flutter extension for better development experience.
4. **Install Chrome**: The app runs on Chrome, so ensure Chrome is installed.

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   If you haven't already cloned the repository, open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yvagula06/Senior-Design-2025.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   Change to the `flutter_stuff_rashed` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Senior-Design-2025/flutter_stuff_rashed
   ```

3. **Fetch Dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the app in Chrome:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

   This will open the application in your default Chrome browser.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Flutter, run:
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  ```
  This will show any missing dependencies or setup issues.

- If the `flutter` command is not recognized, ensure Flutter is installed and added to your PATH.

## Notes

- This guide assumes you are running the application on a web browser (Chrome). If you want to run it on other platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, or desktop), additional setup may be required.
- For any issues, refer to the [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).
